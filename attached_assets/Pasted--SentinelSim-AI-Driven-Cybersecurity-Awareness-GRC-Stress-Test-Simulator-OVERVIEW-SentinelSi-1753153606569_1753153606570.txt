"SentinelSim: AI-Driven Cybersecurity Awareness & GRC Stress Test Simulator"
🌐✨ OVERVIEW
SentinelSim is a dual-purpose, AI-augmented cybersecurity training and GRC validation platform that does two big things:

Simulates real-time, personalized security awareness challenges (e.g., phishing, insider threats) that dynamically adapt to user behavior.

Runs full-scale GRC tabletop crisis simulations (like ransomware + regulatory audit + internal breach) using LLMs as intelligent “actors,” creating an emergent narrative to test your policies, roles, and resilience under fire.

🧩 PROJECT MODULES
1. Phishing & Awareness AI Engine
Generate adaptive phishing campaigns across email, SMS, or Teams/Slack based on user profiles and training history.

GPT-generated scenarios (social engineering, credential theft, urgency traps)

Personalized difficulty scaling

Logs user actions (clicks, submissions, report attempts)

🔧 Tools:
GPT-4 or Claude + SendGrid/Mailgun + Webhook listener + FastAPI

2. AI-Powered Coach
After a user succeeds or fails, a conversational AI provides humanlike coaching: "Here’s how this worked — and how you can outsmart it next time."

GPT-based chatbot (text or TTS)

Feedback tuned to psychological heuristics (e.g., authority bias, urgency)

Gamified points & badges system

🔧 Tools:
LangChain + OpenAI or ElevenLabs TTS + React.js frontend + SQLite/PostgreSQL

3. Crisis Scenario Generator ("GRC Simulator")
Spin up multi-pronged simulated crises to test governance, communication, and policy enforcement.

Example:
🚨 "It’s 2am. A critical system is hit by ransomware. A regulator emails asking for logs. An employee leaks documents anonymously on social media."

GPT simulates characters: attackers, legal, compliance officers, journalists

Slack-style live chat interface with branching AI reactions

Decision points evaluated in real-time

🔧 Tools:
GPT-4 + Personas | WebSocket for real-time sim chat | MongoDB or JSON DB for scenario tree structure

4. Crisis Impact Scoreboard
Evaluate team or individual decisions during a stress scenario with weighted scoring for:

Compliance alignment

Communication clarity

Timeliness of response

Policy adherence

User risk posture (via awareness data)

🔧 Tools:
Streamlit/Plotly dashboard + Scoring engine (custom logic) + exportable PDF reports

5. Audit Trail + Compliance Map
Full visibility into:

Who did what during simulations

Training logs

How the incident touched specific controls (e.g., NIST CSF, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR)

🔧 Tools:
Audit log schema in PostgreSQL + Export to CSV, PDF + Optional integration with GRC platforms (Drata, Tugboat Logic)

📊🛡️ GRC Impact Areas
GRC Pillar	How SentinelSim Supports It
Governance	Validates decision-making authority, accountability, and policy interpretation under pressure.
Risk	Maps behavioral risk from awareness gaps + stress test failures.
Compliance	Produces robust training and incident simulation evidence for auditors and stakeholders.

🧠📚 OPTIONAL ADD-ONS (Advanced)
🎭 LLM Role-Playing Agents: Assign AI agents to emulate roles (CISO, DPO, Hacker, PR team, Regulator).

🧩 Scenario Composer UI: Drag-and-drop builder for creating custom crisis simulations.

🎮 Game Mode: Create a leaderboard of who performs best in high-pressure GRC response sims.

💬 Slack/MS Teams Integration: Play out crises in real workspaces for real immersion.

🚀 MVP STACK
